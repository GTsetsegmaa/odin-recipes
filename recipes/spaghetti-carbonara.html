            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>50g Pecorino Romano cheese, grated</li>
            <li>50g Parmesan cheese, grated</li>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve about 1 cup of pasta water before draining.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, heat a small amount of olive oil over medium heat. Add the whole garlic cloves and saut√© until fragrant, then remove the garlic.</li>
            <li>Add the diced pancetta or guanciale to the skillet and cook until crispy. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, Pecorino Romano, Parmesan cheese, and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet with the pancetta and toss to combine. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta, tossing vigorously to coat the spaghetti without scrambling the eggs. Add reserved pasta water a little at a time to achieve a creamy consistency.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately with extra grated cheese and freshly ground black pepper on top.</li>
        </ol>
