        <h1>Buttermilk Pancakes</h1>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
            <li>Butter or oil for cooking</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, egg, and melted butter.</li>
            <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix; some lumps are okay.</li>
            <li>Heat a griddle or non-stick skillet over medium heat and lightly grease with butter or oil.</li>
            <li>Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Flip the pancakes and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Serve warm with your favorite toppings such as maple syrup, fresh fruit, or whipped cream.</li>
        </ol>
